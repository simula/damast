# damast: Creation of reproducible data processing pipelines

Documentation at: https://simula-srl.gitlab.io/damast

## Installation

# Developer install
    python3 -m pip install -e .[test]

A docker container to install and run the project is in preparation.

## Usage

Use examples liberally, and show the expected output if you can. It's helpful to have inline the smallest example of
usage that you can demonstrate, while providing links to more sophisticated examples if they are too long to reasonably
include in the README.


## Testing

Install the project and use the predefined default test environment:

    tox -e py
